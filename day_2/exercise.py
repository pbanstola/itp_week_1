# ITP Week 1 Day 2 Exercise

# Take an user's input for his age
user_age = input("What's your age buddy? ")
# The user input comes in as a string so we have to cast it to a int!
int_user_age = int(user_age)
# Use an if/else to determine if they are of legal drinking age.
# if the user is of age, print "Welcome!"
# else, tell them to come back in X amount of years (use math operations)

if int_user_age >= 21:
    print("Welcome!")
else:
    diff = 21 - int_user_age
    print("Come back in " + str(diff) + " years!")

# Bonus: Add a validation by checking the type of the user input
# to ensure it can be casted as an int. Handle any other input that
# are not numbers to try again.
